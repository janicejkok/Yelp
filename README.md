Yelp Academic Dataset Project

This project was part of a UC Berkeley Computer Science course.

In this project, I created a Voronoi Diagram visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). 

Simple least-squared linear regression will be used to predict ratings, and k-means algorithm will be used to find the center location of the restaurant clusters.
